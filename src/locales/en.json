    "about_eali_long": "<p>East African Leadership Institute is the result of an initiative by a group of intellectuals and businessmen native to the northern region of Burundi and elsewhere. Having noted the need for higher-education training in Burundi, they sought to meet the country's need for the most highly qualified scientific human resources. This idea is widely shared by administrative leaders from Muyinga Province and the provinces of Kirundo and Cankuzo. It was established under the umbrella of the non-profit Association called the Regional Center for Training and Integrated Development, which received public approval by Ministerial Order No. 530/391 of 16 March 2015 from the Minister of the Interior.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, this initiative responds to the strong demand for higher education following the many primary and secondary schools, especially paramedical secondary schools. Convinced that the only way to address this need is through the intellectual training of a competent youth, the promoters of the initiative decided to establish a higher education program to be offered through the institution called East African Leadership Institute. The institute's motto is \"Knowledge to Build the Future.\" Our aim is to train people capable of undertaking initiatives and creating jobs from the training they acquire.</p>\n\n<p>East African Leadership Institute (EALI) embodies training, innovation, and research at the highest level. Today, it is recognized both in Burundi and abroad for the intensity of its development.</p>",

The latter received authorization to begin its activities following Ministerial Order No. 610/1760 of September 19, 2016. This idea is widely shared by administrative leaders of the provinces in the northern region of Burundi. EALI was created under the umbrella of the Non-Profit Association (ASBL) called the Regional Center for Training and Integrated Development (CRFDI), which was approved by Ministerial Order No. 530/391 of March 16, 2015 by the Minister of the Interior.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, this initiative is a response to the strong demand for higher education training following the many primary and secondary schools, particularly technical schools.</p>\n\n<p>Convinced that the only possible way to meet this need is through the intellectual training of a competent youth, the promoters of the initiative decided to establish a higher education program to be offered through the institution called \"East African Leadership Institute (EALI)\".</p>\n\n<p>EALI started with two training programs, one being a three-year program with two faculties, and the other a two-year professional training program with a single field. The organized faculties are the Faculty of Economic Sciences and Management (FSEG), as well as the Faculty of Science and Technology. Each faculty is oriented according to a chosen option; within the FSEG, there is the option: Management and Accounting, while the Faculty of Science and Technology develops the option: Computer Networks Management. Regarding professional training, EALI trains in Management and Accounting.</p>\n\n<p>Upon completion of the three-year program for the faculties and two years for the Institute, EALI is authorized to award respectively the Bachelor's Degree and the Diploma of Professional Higher Education (DESP).</p>\n\n<p>In its third year of operation, EALI organized, on January 11, 2018, a workshop to validate the training programs it offers. Following this workshop, the training programs offered at EALI were validated by Ministerial Order No. 610/707 of 06/05/2018.</p>\n\n<h4>EALI General Organization</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>EALI Board of Directors</li>\n<li>General Management</li>\n<li>Administrative and Financial Management</li>\n<li>Quality Assurance Management</li>\n<li>Academic Management</li>\n<li>Campus Managers (KAYANZA, NGOZI and MUYINGA)</li>\n<li>Management Attachés</li>\n<li>Deans</li>\n<li>Department Head</li>\n<li>Academic Secretaries</li>\n<li>Student Services Managers</li>\n<li>Accountants</li>\n<li>Cashiers</li>\n<li>Logistics Officers</li>\n<li>Drivers</li>\n</ul>",
